* Prologue
--------------------
The programs are based on the LAOFEC and LAIFEC Fst examples.
I kept or extended the allocation lists, but almost completely 
changed the programs and their flow.
I rewrote them as a computer programmer, not as an SPS pro programmer.
So if you find some concepts used here to be foreign to the field of
plc programming, I beg for forgiveness. Because as strange as you might
find the programs, the example programs were at least as strange to 
me.


* Prerequisites:
-------------------
A copy of Festo FST4.0 or compatible.
An Festo FEC standard plc or compatible.
A serial connection or the tcp/ip bootloader running on the plc.
