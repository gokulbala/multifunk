;; In this model, we try to study the setup of the FESTO MPS system, 
;; such that we can extract parameterized actions. With such actions, 
;; it is thus possible to construct an arbitrarily setup by describing the
;; topology of the system (i.e., how components are combined),
;; and synthesize plans or strategies to achieve certain goal.
;;
;; We try to extract actions for the construction of the following system (constructed in I-6) 
;; (a) 648813 Processing unit
;; (b) 696683 Storing unit
;; (c) Two conveybelt units linked together with one sensor for unit detection (2 sets)
;;
;; In this setting, we define the set of parameterized actions, such that we can perform 
;; a setup a FESTO MPS system by creating an instaintiation of a problem, where topologies are
;; explicitly stated as setup.
;;
;; In this domain, we introduce a color sensor such that when the user asks to read from the 
;; sensor, it is possible to probe the color
